"""Live-coding scratchpad — the same governed call as live_1_chat.py, blocking.

`sync=True` returns a real `openai.OpenAI` instead of `AsyncOpenAI`, governed on
identical terms. No event loop, no `await`, and nothing to forget awaiting.

Every `.` gives full IntelliSense — the two forms are typed overloads, so the
call site narrows to one concrete class rather than a union:

    fabric.llm.client()            -> openai.AsyncOpenAI
    fabric.llm.client(sync=True)   -> openai.OpenAI
    client.                        -> the whole OpenAI surface

Drop the `_paths` line if you have already exported the three
AGENT_FABRIC_LLM_PROXY_* variables in your shell.
