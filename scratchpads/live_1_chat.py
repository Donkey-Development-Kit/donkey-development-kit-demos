"""Live-coding scratchpad — a governed chat completion, in as few lines as it goes.

Type this out on camera. Every `.` gives full IntelliSense:

    fabric.        -> llm, langgraph, adk, strands, anthropic, crewai, …
    fabric.llm.    -> client(), resolve(), list_models()
    client.        -> the whole AsyncOpenAI surface (chat, responses, embeddings…)

Drop the `_paths` line if you have already exported the three
AGENT_FABRIC_LLM_PROXY_* variables in your shell.
